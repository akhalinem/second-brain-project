# Second Brain Mobile App

A lightning-fast audio-first mobile application designed for seamless thought capture and knowledge management on the go.

## 🎯 Vision

The mobile app is the primary capture interface for your second brain, prioritizing **speed and convenience** above all else. Our core philosophy: if capturing a thought takes more than 3 seconds, it's too slow.

## 🎤 Audio-First Approach

We believe voice is the most natural and fastest way to capture thoughts. The app is built around audio recording as the primary input method:

- **Instant capture**: One tap to start recording your thoughts
- **Background recording**: Continue capturing while using other apps
- **Hands-free operation**: Perfect for driving, walking, or any situation where typing isn't practical
- **Natural speech processing**: Speak naturally - we'll handle the rest

## ⚡ Ultra-Fast Access

### Quick Access Methods

- [ ] **Widget integration**: Add recording widget to home screen
- [ ] **Shortcuts app integration**: Create custom Siri shortcuts
- [ ] **Physical button integration**: Use volume buttons or action button for instant recording
- [ ] **Lock screen access**: Record without unlocking your device
- [ ] **Voice activation**: "Hey Siri, record a thought" integration

### Performance Goals

- App launch to recording: **< 2 seconds**
- Widget tap to recording: **< 1 second**
- Physical button to recording: **< 0.5 seconds**

## 🎨 UX Principles

1. **Frictionless**: Remove every unnecessary step between thought and capture
2. **Invisible**: The best interface is no interface - background operation when possible
3. **Forgiving**: Never lose a thought due to technical issues
4. **Contextual**: Adapt to user's current situation and environment
5. **Accessible**: Work for users in any situation - driving, walking, in meetings
